  Gets information about an organization.

  When the value of `two_factor_requirement_enabled` is `true`, the organization requires all members, billing managers, outside collaborators, guest collaborators, repository collaborators, or everyone with access to any repository within the organization to enable [two-factor authentication](https://docs.github.com/articles/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/).

  To see the full details about an organization, the authenticated user must be an organization owner.

  OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `admin:org` scope to see the full details about an organization.

  To see information about an organization's GitHub plan, GitHub Apps need the `Organization plan` permission.
