description: |-
  Creates a new CodeQL variant analysis, which will run a CodeQL query against one or more repositories.

  Get started by learning more about [running CodeQL queries at scale with Multi-Repository Variant Analysis](https://docs.github.com/code-security/codeql-for-vs-code/getting-started-with-codeql-for-vs-code/running-codeql-queries-at-scale-with-multi-repository-variant-analysis).

  Use the `owner` and `repo` parameters in the URL to specify the controller repository that
  will be used for running GitHub Actions workflows and storing the results of the CodeQL variant analysis.
