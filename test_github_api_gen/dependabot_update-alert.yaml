  The authenticated user must have access to security alerts for the repository to use this endpoint. For more information, see "[Granting access to security alerts](https://docs.github.com/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-security-and-analysis-settings-for-your-repository#granting-access-to-security-alerts)."

  OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `security_events` scope to use this endpoint. If this endpoint is only used with public repositories, the token can use the `public_repo` scope instead.
