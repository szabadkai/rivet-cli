name: Create a review comment for a pull request
description: |-
  Creates a review comment on the diff of a specified pull request. To add a regular comment to a pull request timeline, see "[Create an issue comment](https://docs.github.com/rest/issues/comments#create-an-issue-comment)."

  If your comment applies to more than one line in the pull request diff, you should use the parameters `line`, `side`, and optionally `start_line` and `start_side` in your request.

  The `position` parameter is closing down. If you use `position`, the `line`, `side`, `start_line`, and `start_side` parameters are not required.

  This endpoint triggers [notifications](https://docs.github.com/github/managing-subscriptions-and-notifications-on-github/about-notifications).
