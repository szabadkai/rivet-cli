name: Get community profile metrics
description: |-
  Returns all community profile metrics for a repository. The repository cannot be a fork.

  README, and CONTRIBUTING files.

  the recommended community health files are present. For more information, see
  "[About community profiles for public repositories](https://docs.github.com/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/about-community-profiles-for-public-repositories)."
