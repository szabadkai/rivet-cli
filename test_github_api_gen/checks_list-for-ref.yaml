name: List check runs for a Git reference
description: |-
  Lists check runs for a commit ref. The `ref` can be a SHA, branch name, or a tag name.

  > [!NOTE]
  > The endpoints to manage checks only look for pushes in the repository where the check suite or check run were created. Pushes to a branch in a forked repository are not detected and return an empty `pull_requests` array.

  If there are more than 1000 check suites on a single git reference, this endpoint will limit check runs to the 1000 most recent check suites. To iterate over all possible check runs, use the [List check suites for a Git reference](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/checks#list-check-suites-for-a-git-reference) endpoint and provide the `check_suite_id` parameter to the [List check runs in a check suite](https://docs.github.com/rest/reference/checks#list-check-runs-in-a-check-suite) endpoint.

  OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` scope to use this endpoint on a private repository.
