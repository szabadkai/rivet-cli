  Gets a single check run using its `id`.

  > [!NOTE]
  > The Checks API only looks for pushes in the repository where the check suite or check run were created. Pushes to a branch in a forked repository are not detected and return an empty `pull_requests` array.

  OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` scope to use this endpoint on a private repository.
