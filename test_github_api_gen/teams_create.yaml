name: Create a team
description: |-
  To create a team, the authenticated user must be a member or owner of `{org}`. By default, organization members can create teams. Organization owners can limit team creation to organization owners. For more information, see "[Setting team creation permissions](https://docs.github.com/articles/setting-team-creation-permissions-in-your-organization)."

  When you create a new team, you automatically become a team maintainer without explicitly adding yourself to the optional array of `maintainers`. For more information, see "[About teams](https://docs.github.com/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/about-teams)".
