name: Create an attestation
description: |-
  Store an artifact attestation and associate it with a repository.

  The authenticated user must have write permission to the repository and, if using a fine-grained access token, the `attestations:write` permission is required.

  Artifact attestations are meant to be created using the [attest action](https://github.com/actions/attest). For more information, see our guide on [using artifact attestations to establish a build's provenance](https://docs.github.com/actions/security-guides/using-artifact-attestations-to-establish-provenance-for-builds).
