name: Get a tree
description: |-
  Returns a single tree using the SHA1 value or ref name for that tree.

  If `truncated` is `true` in the response then the number of items in the `tree` array exceeded our maximum limit. If you need to fetch more items, use the non-recursive method of fetching trees, and fetch one sub-tree at a time.

  > [!NOTE]
  > The limit for the `tree` array is 100,000 entries with a maximum size of 7 MB when using the `recursive` parameter.
