name: Get commit authors
description: |-
  Each type of source control system represents authors in a different way. For example, a Git commit author has a display name and an email address, but a Subversion commit author just has a username. The GitHub Importer will make the author information valid, but the author might not be correct. For example, it will change the bare Subversion username `hubot` into something like `hubot <hubot@12341234-abab-fefe-8787-fedcba987654>`.

  This endpoint and the [Map a commit author](https://docs.github.com/rest/migrations/source-imports#map-a-commit-author) endpoint allow you to provide correct Git author information.

  > [!WARNING]
  > **Endpoint closing down notice:** Due to very low levels of usage and available alternatives, this endpoint is closing down and will no longer be available from 00:00 UTC on April 12, 2024. For more details and alternatives, see the [changelog](https://gh.io/source-imports-api-deprecation).
