name: Create a registration token for an organization
description: |-
  Returns a token that you can pass to the `config` script. The token expires after one hour.

  For example, you can replace `TOKEN` in the following example with the registration token provided by this endpoint to configure your self-hosted runner:

  ```
  ./config.sh --url https://github.com/octo-org --token TOKEN
  ```

  Authenticated users must have admin access to the organization to use this endpoint.

  OAuth tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the`admin:org` scope to use this endpoint. If the repository is private, OAuth tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` scope to use this endpoint.
