name: Download a repository archive (zip)
description: |-
  Gets a redirect URL to download a zip archive for a repository. If you omit `:ref`, the repository’s default branch (usually
  `main`) will be used. Please make sure your HTTP framework is configured to follow redirects or you will need to use
  the `Location` header to make a second `GET` request.

  > [!NOTE]
  > For private repositories, these links are temporary and expire after five minutes. If the repository is empty, you will receive a 404 when you follow the redirect.
