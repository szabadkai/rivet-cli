  Provides publicly available information about someone with a GitHub account.

  If you are requesting information about an [Enterprise Managed User](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/managing-iam/understanding-iam-for-enterprises/about-enterprise-managed-users), or a GitHub App bot that is installed in an organization that uses Enterprise Managed Users, your requests must be authenticated as a user or GitHub App that has access to the organization to view that account's information. If you are not authorized, the request will return a `404 Not Found` status.

  The `email` key in the following response is the publicly visible email address from your GitHub [profile page](https://github.com/settings/profile). When setting up your profile, you can select a primary email address to be public which provides an email entry for this endpoint. If you do not set a public email address for `email`, then it will have a value of `null`. You only see publicly visible email addresses when authenticated with GitHub. For more information, see [Authentication](https://docs.github.com/rest/guides/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#authentication).

  The Emails API enables you to list all of your email addresses, and toggle a primary email to be visible publicly. For more information, see [Emails API](https://docs.github.com/rest/users/emails).
