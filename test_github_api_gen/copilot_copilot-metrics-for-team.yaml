name: Get Copilot metrics for a team
description: |-
  Use this endpoint to see a breakdown of aggregated metrics for various GitHub Copilot features. See the response schema tab for detailed metrics definitions.

  > [!NOTE]
  > This endpoint will only return results for a given day if the team had **five or more members with active Copilot licenses** on that day, as evaluated at the end of that day.

  The response contains metrics for up to 100 days prior. Metrics are processed once per day for the previous day,
  and the response will only include data up until yesterday. In order for an end user to be counted towards these metrics,
  they must have telemetry enabled in their IDE.

  To access this endpoint, the Copilot Metrics API access policy must be enabled for the organization containing the team within GitHub settings.
  Only organization owners for the organization that contains this team and owners and billing managers of the parent enterprise can view Copilot metrics for a team.

  OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need either the `manage_billing:copilot`, `read:org`, or `read:enterprise` scopes to use this endpoint.
