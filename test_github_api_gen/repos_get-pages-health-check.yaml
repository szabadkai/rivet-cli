description: |-
  Gets a health check of the DNS settings for the `CNAME` record configured for a repository's GitHub Pages.

  The first request to this endpoint returns a `202 Accepted` status and starts an asynchronous background task to get the results for the domain. After the background task completes, subsequent requests to this endpoint return a `200 OK` status with the health check results in the response.
