name: Set selected repositories for an organization secret
description: |-
  Replaces all repositories for an organization secret when the `visibility`
  for repository access is set to `selected`. The visibility is set when you [Create
  or update an organization secret](https://docs.github.com/rest/actions/secrets#create-or-update-an-organization-secret).

  Authenticated users must have collaborator access to a repository to create, update, or read secrets.

  OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `admin:org` scope to use this endpoint. If the repository is private, the `repo` scope is also required.
