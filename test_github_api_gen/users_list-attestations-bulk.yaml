name: List attestations by bulk subject digests
description: |-
  List a collection of artifact attestations associated with any entry in a list of subject digests owned by a user.

  The collection of attestations returned by this endpoint is filtered according to the authenticated user's permissions; if the authenticated user cannot read a repository, the attestations associated with that repository will not be included in the response. In addition, when using a fine-grained access token the `attestations:read` permission is required.

  **Please note:** in order to offer meaningful security benefits, an attestation's signature and timestamps **must** be cryptographically verified, and the identity of the attestation signer **must** be validated. Attestations can be verified using the [GitHub CLI `attestation verify` command](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_attestation_verify). For more information, see [our guide on how to use artifact attestations to establish a build's provenance](https://docs.github.com/actions/security-guides/using-artifact-attestations-to-establish-provenance-for-builds).
