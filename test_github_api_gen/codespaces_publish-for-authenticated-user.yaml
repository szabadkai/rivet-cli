name: Create a repository from an unpublished codespace
description: |-
  Publishes an unpublished codespace, creating a new repository and assigning it to the codespace.

  The codespace's token is granted write permissions to the repository, allowing the user to push their changes.

  This will fail for a codespace that is already published, meaning it has an associated repository.

  OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `codespace` scope to use this endpoint.
