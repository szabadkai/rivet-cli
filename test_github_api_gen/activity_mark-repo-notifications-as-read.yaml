name: Mark repository notifications as read
description: Marks all notifications in a repository as "read" for the current user. If the number of notifications is too large to complete in one request, you will receive a `202 Accepted` status and GitHub will run an asynchronous process to mark notifications as "read." To check whether any "unread" notifications remain, you can use the [List repository notifications for the authenticated user](https://docs.github.com/rest/activity/notifications#list-repository-notifications-for-the-authenticated-user) endpoint and pass the query parameter `all=false`.
