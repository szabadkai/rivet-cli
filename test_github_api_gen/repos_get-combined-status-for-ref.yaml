name: Get the combined status for a specific reference
description: |-
  Users with pull access in a repository can access a combined view of commit statuses for a given ref. The ref can be a SHA, a branch name, or a tag name.


  Additionally, a combined `state` is returned. The `state` is one of:

  *   **failure** if any of the contexts report as `error` or `failure`
  *   **pending** if there are no statuses or a context is `pending`
  *   **success** if the latest status for all contexts is `success`
