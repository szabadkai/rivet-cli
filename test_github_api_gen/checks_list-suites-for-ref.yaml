name: List check suites for a Git reference
description: |-
  Lists check suites for a commit `ref`. The `ref` can be a SHA, branch name, or a tag name.

  > [!NOTE]
  > The endpoints to manage checks only look for pushes in the repository where the check suite or check run were created. Pushes to a branch in a forked repository are not detected and return an empty `pull_requests` array and a `null` value for `head_branch`.

  OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` scope to use this endpoint on a private repository.
