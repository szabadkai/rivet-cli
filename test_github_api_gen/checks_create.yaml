name: Create a check run
description: |-
  Creates a new check run for a specific commit in a repository.

  To create a check run, you must use a GitHub App. OAuth apps and authenticated users are not able to create a check suite.

  In a check suite, GitHub limits the number of check runs with the same name to 1000. Once these check runs exceed 1000, GitHub will start to automatically delete older check runs.

  > [!NOTE]
  > The Checks API only looks for pushes in the repository where the check suite or check run were created. Pushes to a branch in a forked repository are not detected and return an empty `pull_requests` array.
