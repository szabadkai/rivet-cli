name: List issues assigned to the authenticated user
description: |-
  List issues assigned to the authenticated user across all visible repositories including owned repositories, member
  repositories, and organization repositories. You can use the `filter` query parameter to fetch issues that are not
  necessarily assigned to you.

  > [!NOTE]
  > GitHub's REST API considers every pull request an issue, but not every issue is a pull request. For this reason, "Issues" endpoints may return both issues and pull requests in the response. You can identify pull requests by the `pull_request` key. Be aware that the `id` of a pull request returned from "Issues" endpoints will be an _issue id_. To find out the pull request id, use the "[List pull requests](https://docs.github.com/rest/pulls/pulls#list-pull-requests)" endpoint.

  This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more information, see "[Media types](https://docs.github.com/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types)."

  - **`application/vnd.github.raw+json`**: Returns the raw markdown body. Response will include `body`. This is the default if you do not pass any specific media type.
  - **`application/vnd.github.text+json`**: Returns a text only representation of the markdown body. Response will include `body_text`.
  - **`application/vnd.github.html+json`**: Returns HTML rendered from the body's markdown. Response will include `body_html`.
  - **`application/vnd.github.full+json`**: Returns raw, text, and HTML representations. Response will include `body`, `body_text`, and `body_html`.
