  can submit approving pull request reviews. For more information, see
  "[Setting the permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN for your organization](https://docs.github.com/organizations/managing-organization-settings/disabling-or-limiting-github-actions-for-your-organization#setting-the-permissions-of-the-github_token-for-your-organization)."
