name: Create or update file contents
description: |-
  Creates a new file or replaces an existing file in a repository.

  > [!NOTE]
  > If you use this endpoint and the "[Delete a file](https://docs.github.com/rest/repos/contents/#delete-a-file)" endpoint in parallel, the concurrent requests will conflict and you will receive errors. You must use these endpoints serially instead.

  OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` scope to use this endpoint. The `workflow` scope is also required in order to modify files in the `.github/workflows` directory.
