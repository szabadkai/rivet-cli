name: List secret scanning alerts for an enterprise
description: |-
  Lists secret scanning alerts for eligible repositories in an enterprise, from newest to oldest.

  Alerts are only returned for organizations in the enterprise for which the authenticated user is an organization owner or a [security manager](https://docs.github.com/organizations/managing-peoples-access-to-your-organization-with-roles/managing-security-managers-in-your-organization).

  The authenticated user must be a member of the enterprise in order to use this endpoint.

  OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` scope or `security_events` scope to use this endpoint.
