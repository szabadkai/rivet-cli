name: Set a thread subscription
description: |-
  If you are watching a repository, you receive notifications for all threads by default. Use this endpoint to ignore future notifications for threads until you comment on the thread or get an **@mention**.

  You can also use this endpoint to subscribe to threads that you are currently not receiving notifications for or to subscribed to threads that you have previously ignored.

  Unsubscribing from a conversation in a repository that you are not watching is functionally equivalent to the [Delete a thread subscription](https://docs.github.com/rest/activity/notifications#delete-a-thread-subscription) endpoint.
