description: Unlocks a repository. You can lock repositories when you [start a user migration](https://docs.github.com/rest/migrations/users#start-a-user-migration). Once the migration is complete you can unlock each repository to begin using it again or [delete the repository](https://docs.github.com/rest/repos/repos#delete-a-repository) if you no longer need the source data. Returns a status of `404 Not Found` if the repository is not locked.
