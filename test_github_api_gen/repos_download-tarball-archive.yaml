  Gets a redirect URL to download a tar archive for a repository. If you omit `:ref`, the repository’s default branch (usually
  `main`) will be used. Please make sure your HTTP framework is configured to follow redirects or you will need to use
  the `Location` header to make a second `GET` request.
