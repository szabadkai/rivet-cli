name: Review custom deployment protection rules for a workflow run
description: |-
  Approve or reject custom deployment protection rules provided by a GitHub App for a workflow run. For more information, see "[Using environments for deployment](https://docs.github.com/actions/deployment/targeting-different-environments/using-environments-for-deployment)."

  > [!NOTE]
  > GitHub Apps can only review their own custom deployment protection rules. To approve or reject pending deployments that are waiting for review from a specific person or team, see [`POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/actions/runs/{run_id}/pending_deployments`](/rest/actions/workflow-runs#review-pending-deployments-for-a-workflow-run).

  OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` scope to use this endpoint with a private repository.
