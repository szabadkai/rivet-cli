name: Get a CodeQL database for a repository
description: |-
  Gets a CodeQL database for a language in a repository.

  By default this endpoint returns JSON metadata about the CodeQL database. To
  download the CodeQL database binary content, set the `Accept` header of the request
  to [`application/zip`](https://docs.github.com/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types), and make sure
  your HTTP client is configured to follow redirects or use the `Location` header
  to make a second request to get the redirect URL.

  OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` scope to use this endpoint with private or public repositories, or the `public_repo` scope to use this endpoint with only public repositories.
