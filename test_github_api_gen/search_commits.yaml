  Find commits via various criteria on the default branch (usually `main`). This method returns up to 100 results [per page](https://docs.github.com/rest/guides/using-pagination-in-the-rest-api).

  When searching for commits, you can get text match metadata for the **message** field when you provide the `text-match` media type. For more details about how to receive highlighted search results, see [Text match
  metadata](https://docs.github.com/rest/search/search#text-match-metadata).

  For example, if you want to find commits related to CSS in the [octocat/Spoon-Knife](https://github.com/octocat/Spoon-Knife) repository. Your query would look something like this:

  `q=repo:octocat/Spoon-Knife+css`
env: null
