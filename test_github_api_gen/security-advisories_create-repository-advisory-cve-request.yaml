name: Request a CVE for a repository security advisory
description: |-
  If you want a CVE identification number for the security vulnerability in your project, and don't already have one, you can request a CVE identification number from GitHub. For more information see "[Requesting a CVE identification number](https://docs.github.com/code-security/security-advisories/repository-security-advisories/publishing-a-repository-security-advisory#requesting-a-cve-identification-number-optional)."

  You may request a CVE for public repositories, but cannot do so for private repositories.

  In order to request a CVE for a repository security advisory, the authenticated user must be a security manager or administrator of that repository.

  OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` or `repository_advisories:write` scope to use this endpoint.
