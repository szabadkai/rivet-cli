name: List selected repositories for an organization secret
description: |-
  Lists all repositories that have been selected when the `visibility`
  for repository access to a secret is set to `selected`.

  Authenticated users must have collaborator access to a repository to create, update, or read secrets.

  OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `admin:org` scope to use this endpoint. If the repository is private, the `repo` scope is also required.
