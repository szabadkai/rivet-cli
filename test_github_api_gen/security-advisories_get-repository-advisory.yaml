name: Get a repository security advisory
description: |-
  Get a repository security advisory using its GitHub Security Advisory (GHSA) identifier.

  Anyone can access any published security advisory on a public repository.

  The authenticated user can access an unpublished security advisory from a repository if they are a security manager or administrator of that repository, or if they are a
  collaborator on the security advisory.

  OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the `repo` or `repository_advisories:read` scope to to get a published security advisory in a private repository, or any unpublished security advisory that the authenticated user has access to.
