name: Upload an analysis as SARIF data
description: "Uploads SARIF data containing the results of a code scanning analysis to make the results available in a repository. For troubleshooting information, see \"[Troubleshooting SARIF uploads](https://docs.github.com/code-security/code-scanning/troubleshooting-sarif).\"\n\nThere are two places where you can upload code scanning results.\n - If you upload to a pull request, for example `--ref refs/pull/42/merge` or `--ref refs/pull/42/head`, then the results appear as alerts in a pull request check. For more information, see \"[Triaging code scanning alerts in pull requests](/code-security/secure-coding/triaging-code-scanning-alerts-in-pull-requests).\"\n - If you upload to a branch, for example `--ref refs/heads/my-branch`, then the results appear in the **Security** tab for your repository. For more information, see \"[Managing code scanning alerts for your repository](/code-security/secure-coding/managing-code-scanning-alerts-for-your-repository#viewing-the-alerts-for-a-repository).\"\n\nYou must compress the SARIF-formatted analysis data that you want to upload, using `gzip`, and then encode it as a Base64 format string. For example:\n\n```\ngzip -c analysis-data.sarif | base64 -w0\n```\n\nSARIF upload supports a maximum number of entries per the following data objects, and an analysis will be rejected if any of these objects is above its maximum value. For some objects, there are additional values over which the entries will be ignored while keeping the most important entries whenever applicable.\nTo get the most out of your analysis when it includes data above the supported limits, try to optimize the analysis configuration. For example, for the CodeQL tool, identify and remove the most noisy queries.
