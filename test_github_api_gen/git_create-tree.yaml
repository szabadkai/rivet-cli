name: Create a tree
description: |-
  The tree creation API accepts nested entries. If you specify both a tree and a nested path modifying that tree, this endpoint will overwrite the contents of the tree with the new path contents, and create a new tree structure.

  If you use this endpoint to add, delete, or modify the file contents in a tree, you will need to commit the tree and then update a branch to point to the commit. For more information see "[Create a commit](https://docs.github.com/rest/git/commits#create-a-commit)" and "[Update a reference](https://docs.github.com/rest/git/refs#update-a-reference)."

  Returns an error if you try to delete a file that does not exist.
